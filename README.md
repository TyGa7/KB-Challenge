1. Download files and place them all within the same directory.

2. Make sure the following packages with latest versions are installed:
  - Node.js
  - npm
  - The following Node.js modules (by running "npm install 'package name'"):
      - express
      - cors
      - fetch
      - fs
      - nconf
      - stringify
   
   **The packages need to be saved in "/root directory/node_modules"**
   
3. Open up a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are saved.
4. Double-click the index.html file to start the front-end software. (Only tested with Microsoft
   Edge and Google Chrome)
5. In the command prompt, use the following command to start the server: "node server.js"
    - Note: must have Node.js installed for this to work!
6. As changes are made to the front-end software (creating tickets, etc.) the KanBan board state 
   will be updated and written to the state.txt file in the main directory.
